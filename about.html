        <h2>About Detective Conan</h2>
        <p>Case Closed, also known as Detective Conan (Japanese: 名探偵コナン, Hepburn: Meitantei Konan, lit. 'Great Detective Conan'), is a Japanese detective manga series written and illustrated by Gosho Aoyama. It has been serialized in Shogakukan's shōnen manga magazine Weekly Shōnen Sunday since January 1994; its chapters are collected in 106 tankōbon volumes as of October 2024. Because of legal problems with the name Detective Conan, the English language releases from Funimation and Viz Media were renamed Case Closed. The story follows the high school detective Shinichi Kudo, whose body was transformed into that of an elementary school-age child while investigating a mysterious organization. Generally, he solves a multitude of cases by impersonating his childhood best friend's father and various other characters.</p>
